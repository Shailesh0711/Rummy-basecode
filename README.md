## Introduction

Rummy revolves around the challenge of creating sets and runs of cards before your opponents do. The game provides an engaging platform for players to showcase their card-playing prowess, making every move and decision crucial to success.

## Features

Card Sets: Players aim to form valid sets of cards, either by creating runs (consecutive cards of the same suit) or sets (three or four cards of the same rank).

Drawing and Discarding: Players take turns drawing cards from a central deck or discard pile. After drawing, they must discard a card to end their turn.

Jokers: Some variations include the use of joker cards, which can be used as substitutes for any other card in a set.

Gameplay Variations: Rummy comes in various forms, such as Gin Rummy, Indian Rummy, and more, each with its own set of rules.

Scoring: Points are typically awarded based on the cards left in a player's hand when someone goes out (ends the round by playing all their cards).

## HowToPlay

Dealing: Players are dealt a certain number of cards, and the rest form the draw pile.

Objective: Form valid sets and runs by drawing and discarding cards.

Melding: Once a player has formed a complete hand, they declare and reveal their sets/runs.

Scoring: Points are calculated based on the cards left in the opponents' hands.

Next Round: The game continues with subsequent rounds until a predetermined score is reached.
